# LifeXP: Gamified Journalling Chatbot

LifeXP combines gamification and journalling into a chatbot.

## Features

### Convenient

We bring our phones with us everywhere we go, and we spend a large part of our time communicating with people through chat apps like Telegram. Journalling has never been easier — it’s only one text message away.

### Conversational

We tell stories to other people all the time. Conversations are a natural way of telling people about what happened and how we felt. LifeXP combines this organic conversation together with an introspective journalling session to reflect.

### Flexible

Your journal entry can be however long you want. LifeXP tries not to do too much or interfere with your entries, it’s only there to facilitate your thoughts.
