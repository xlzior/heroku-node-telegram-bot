# LifeXP Demo

LifeXP combines gamification and journalling into a chatbot. It aims to provide a safe, fun and convenient way for you to pen down your thoughts and even organise them for browsing later.

## Journal

`/open`

Open up LifeXP on Telegram. Take a deep breath. Time to start journalling.

`/prompt`

Not sure what to journal about? LifeXP can provide you with a random prompt.

`/echo`

If you have a question in mind that you want to explore further, LifeXP can echo the question for you, to help visually break up the entry into sections.

Emojis

Let all those emotions out however you wish — including emojis. LifeXP will use your emojis to gauge how you’re feeling.

Hashtags

You may use hashtags at any point during your entry. Possible hashtags include emotions, areas of your life, or challenges you’re facing. They’ll come in handy later!

`/ididathing`

Even the little things in life should be celebrated. LifeXP helps you celebrate your achievements, big or small. Answer a series of simple questions about your achievement, and be rewarded with XP for it!

`/close`

When your reflection has reached a natural close, it’s time to wrap up the conversation and give it a name for future reference.

## Browse

`/reflections`

Browse reflections in reverse chronological order.

`/hashtags`

Browse all hashtags used in descending order of frequency.

`/hashtag`

Browse reflections by hashtag.

## Game Features

`/lifexp`: Experience Points and Levels

This command creates a pinned message in the chat which acts as a status bar. As you earn XP through journalling, `/ididathing` or waking up on time, the status bar will be updated with your current XP and level.

Keep up a journalling streak -- journal consistently every day to maintain your streak count.

Achievement Badges

The achievement badges you’ve earned can be viewed under the chat’s “shared media”.

Use `/achievements` to list out all your achievement badges again in sorted order.

`/stats`

View statistics about your journal entries with LifeXP.

## Quests

LifeXP quests provide you with a series of question prompts around a theme. They provide a more structured journalling session.

## Scheduled Journalling Sessions

LifeXP can send you a fixed set of prompts every day at a time of your choosing.

Use `/manage_schedules` to get started.

## Bedtime

Struggling to keep up a consistent sleep schedule? Use `/set_bedtime` to set goals for going to sleep and waking up on time.

Send `/good_morning` when you wake up and `/good_night` when you go to bed to be rewarded with XP for sticking to your goals.
