**`/echo`**: If you have a question in mind that you want to explore further, LifeXP can echo the question for you, to help visually break up the entry into sections.

**Emojis**: Let all those emotions out however you wish — including emojis. LifeXP will use your emojis to gauge how you’re feeling.

**Hashtags**: You may use hashtags at any point during your entry. Possible hashtags include emotions, areas of your life, or challenges you’re facing. They’ll come in handy later!

**`/ididathing`**: Even the little things in life should be celebrated. LifeXP helps you celebrate your achievements, big or small. Answer a series of simple questions about your achievement, and be rewarded with XP for it!

**`/close`**: When your reflection has reached a natural close, it’s time to wrap up the conversation and give it a name for future reference.

## 🎮 Game Features

Earn XP through journalling, `/ididathing` or waking up on time. Make full use of LifeXP's features to earn all achievement badges!

**`/lifexp`**: This command creates a pinned message in the chat which acts as a status bar. As you earn XP, the status bar will be updated with your current XP and level. Keep up a journalling streak -- journal consistently every day to maintain your streak count.

**Achievement Badges**: The achievement badges you’ve earned can be viewed under the chat’s “shared media”. Use `/achievements` to list out all your achievement badges again in sorted order.

**`/stats`**: View statistics about your journal entries with LifeXP.

## ⏰ Scheduled Journalling Sessions

LifeXP can send you a fixed set of prompts every day at a time of your choosing.

Use `/manage_schedules` to get started.

At your selected time, the bot will automatically start the conversation to prompt you to journal.

## 🛌 Bedtime

Struggling to keep up a consistent sleep schedule? Use `/set_bedtime` to set goals for going to sleep and waking up on time.

Send `/good_morning` when you wake up and `/good_night` when you go to bed to be rewarded with XP for sticking to your goals.
